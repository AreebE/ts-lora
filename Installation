192.168.0.2

Recommended setup:
- The Raspberry Pi must serve as Access Point and DHCP server. You can follow the instructions of [1].
- The RPi must have an IP of 192.168.0.254/255 (you can change the IPs according to your needs).
- Edit the RPi configuration files so that gw_req and gw_data always assigned with an IP of .1 and .2 respectively. To do this, you will need the wifi mac address of the Pycom nodes. You can add multiple 1-channel gw_data gateways assigned with a different SF (LoRa) and IP address (wifi).
- Flash the corresponding code into the gateways and nodes. Remember to use a different node ID for each node.
- Run the TCP server on the RPi.
- Power-up the gateways. Be sure that the LEDs turn green and blue. It would be helpful to have the gateways connected to a computer with a monitor so you can see their standard output.
- Power-up at least one node.

Enjoy!
