# TS-LoRa 

Experimental implementation for native ESP32 devices like Heltec, TTGO etc.

Tested only with 1 node and 1 type of device (Heltec LoRa32 V2, 433MHz, SF7)

Some functionalities are still missing. Work in progress...

Currently not compatible with Pycom devices (use the main code instead).

LoRa library: https://github.com/wybiral/micropython-lora
