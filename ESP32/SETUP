192.168.1.12 (SF12)

Recommended setup:
- You will need: 1 Raspberry Pi or laptop, 2 ESP32 devices to serve as 1-channel gateways, 1 or more Lopy4 or Fipy nodes
- Flash all devices using the micropython firmware v1.19.2
- The Raspberry Pi (RPi) serves as the Access Point for the GWs. You can follow the instructions here [1] how to setup a dhcpcd and a hostap server.
- According to the current git code, the RPi must have an IP of 192.168.1.202/24 (you can change the IPs according to your needs).
- Edit the RPi configuration files so that gw_req and gw_data are always assigned with an IP of .2/24 and .7-12/24, respectively. 
  To do this, you will need the wifi mac address of the nodes. You can add multiple 1-channel gw_data gateways assigned with a different SF (LoRa) and IP address (wifi).
- Edit the node id file (ids) and add the node MACs and your ids. (note that the current code accepts node ids from 11 to 35 (dec))
- Flash the corresponding code into the gateways (2 or more) and nodes (1 or more). 
- Run the TCP server (net-server.py) script on the RPi.
- Power-up the gateways. It would be helpful to have the gateways connected to a computer so you can see their standard output.
- Power-up at least one node.
- Run the init server script (init_exp.py) to initiate an experiment and collect statistics (default 192.168.1.2).
  example: with "python3 init_exp.py 100" all the nodes will send out 100 packets and report statistics.

Enjoy!
